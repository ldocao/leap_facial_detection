#technical goal
The goal of this project is to predict the location of 31 face key points (eg: left_eye_center, right_eye_center, etc.) based on the grayscale image only, using neural networks. This is why the X variable (the features) contains the "image" column, while y contains the target variables (the 31 face key points).
